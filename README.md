# My calculator

A completely unnecessary program that helps you do the most basic math operations, while telling you that you need to learn basic math.

## Features

Addition (because apparently you need help with 2+2)
- Subtraction (like subtracting brain cells while using this)
- Multiplication (wow, fancy)
- Division (if you can handle it)
- Custom roasts for every operation so you never forget your failures.


## How It Works
1. Run the script in Python
2. Enter your name
3. Input two numbers 
4. Pick an operation
5. Get your answer

## Requirements
- Python 3
